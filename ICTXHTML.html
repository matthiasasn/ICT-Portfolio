<p> You can't see the rules being applied here in the browser output, but you can see it at notepad. </p>
<br/>
<p> As you can see in notepad, all the rules of XHTML have been applied.
<br> Proper nesting and tag closing is shown in the heading.
<br> All elements are in lowercase characters.
<br> The root element is html.
<br> All values are quoted, like in the noshade value of horizontal rule tag.
<br> All attributes are not minimized.
<br> And lastly, all contents are inside block-level elements.
